# Dynamic-Twitter
Simple Twitter clone built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The clone supports dynamic rendering based on user data using mock JSON in place of what would be data retrievals from external API's. Implemented Webpack to bundle assets
(enter '?user=user1' at the end of the URL to demo dynamically loading profiles)
